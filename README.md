## Xcode CodeSnippets

There is a collection of my code snippets for Xcode & Swift. 


## Compatibility
They work fine in Xcode 15. All original `.codesnippet` files are stored here:

```

 ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/

```


## Install
1. Download the entire repository or just the `.codesnippet` files you need.
2. Drag & Drop `.codesnippet` files into the Xcode CodeSnippets folder manually or use the Terminal to do this:
- Click `New Terminal at folder`
- Run `cp *.codesnippet ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets`
